Ok honestly, coding was never on my radar
I've gone through two bachelors.. both within the medical/ science field believing it's somthing I wanted to do.
Now I'm working in a job that kind of relates but also kind of doesn't and i just feel STUCK

I knew my best friend's boyfriend stopped his bachelors to pursue a career in coding at another program. I really didn't think much about it except it possibly being a risky move a couple of years ago. Fast forward to now, I've been going out more and trying to network because I love meeting interesting poeple and learning about their journeys/ background.
Guess what? I met 2 more people that were also in the realm of coding. One has a background in data science and the other in cyber security.

I know it seems I'm going off topic but I swear I'm getting to the point soon.
I talked to each person to try to ge an idea of what they did and if they and I could possibly see myself being able to survive this unknown world.

Before starting my program I dabbled in some HTML and CSS which i actually really liked.
